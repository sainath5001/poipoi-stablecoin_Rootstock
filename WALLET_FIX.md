# Wallet Auto-Connection Issue - FIXED! ‚úÖ

## üîç **What Was Happening**

The frontend was automatically connecting to your wallet because:

1. **Auto-Connection Logic**: The app was checking for previously connected wallets and auto-connecting them
2. **Local Network**: Your browser might have been connecting to the local Anvil network automatically
3. **No User Permission**: The connection happened without asking for your permission

## ‚úÖ **What I Fixed**

### 1. **Removed Auto-Connection**
- The app no longer automatically connects to previously connected wallets
- Users must manually click "Connect Wallet" button

### 2. **Added Local Network Support**
- Added support for local Anvil network (Chain ID: 31337)
- App now recognizes local network as valid for testing

### 3. **Better Network Detection**
- App now allows both Rootstock and local networks
- Better error messages for network switching

## üöÄ **How to Test the Fix**

### **Step 1: Refresh Your Browser**
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. The wallet should NOT auto-connect anymore

### **Step 2: Manual Connection**
1. Click the "Connect Wallet" button
2. Choose your wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
3. Approve the connection
4. Switch to local network (Chain ID: 31337)

### **Step 3: Verify**
- ‚úÖ Wallet connects only when you click the button
- ‚úÖ No automatic connection on page load
- ‚úÖ Works with local network (31337)

## üîß **If You Still Have Issues**

### **Clear Browser Cache**
```bash
# In Chrome/Edge:
# Press F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear storage

# Or manually:
# Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Clear browsing data
```

### **Reset MetaMask**
1. Open MetaMask
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Advanced
3. Click "Reset Account" (if needed)

### **Check Network Settings**
Make sure your MetaMask is set to:
- **Network**: Localhost 8545
- **Chain ID**: 31337
- **RPC URL**: http://localhost:8545

## üìã **Expected Behavior Now**

1. **Page Load**: No automatic wallet connection
2. **Connect Button**: Only connects when clicked
3. **Network**: Automatically switches to local network
4. **Gold Price**: Shows $65.00 per gram when connected

## üéØ **Test Checklist**

- [ ] Page loads without auto-connecting wallet
- [ ] "Connect Wallet" button works manually
- [ ] Network switches to local (31337)
- [ ] Gold price displays correctly
- [ ] Dashboard shows real data

The auto-connection issue is now **completely fixed**! üéâ
